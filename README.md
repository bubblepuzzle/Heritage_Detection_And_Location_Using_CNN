# Heritage_Detection_And_Location_Using_CNN
Heritage Detection And Location Using the CNN in which accuracy has achieved accuracy 99.84% making the project novelty and The model’s performance has improved, and the accuracy was also not compromised. Heritage monuments, the tangible embodiments of a nation's historical narratives and architectural excellence, serve as irreplaceable assets. Preserving and documenting the world's heritage monuments is of at-most importance for cultural preservation and historical research.Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML), represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast array of industries.The idea is to use and improve AI/ML algorithm for historical monuments identification and to locate their addressThe project introduces a novel approach for automatically detecting and locating heritage monuments using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and find the address of the monument using geospatial coordinates.**Initially the model has been trained with four convolutions and two max pools, but the performance is slow. Then the model has been trained using two convolution filters with ReLU and two Max pools, one flatten and one dense layers. The model’s performance has improved, and the accuracy was also not compromised. **![image](https://github.com/bubblepuzzle/Heritage_Detection_And_Location_Using_CNN/assets/75856777/1cafc075-e0cd-44e9-88bb-c86b8f7e21b6)The accuracy of the predictions if same data is used for validation and testing is 99.84% which quite impressive fitThe algorithm identifies images even if there is tilt up-to 30 degreesThe model works on different sizes of the images
